# GPT Suggestions for Round 2 (Grok to Review)

## 1. Dependency and Typings Management
- Ensure only one source of typings for each dependency (e.g., use only `@types/vscode` for VS Code APIs, avoid deprecated `vscode` package).
- Regularly update the `engines.vscode` field to match the minimum version required by your extension features, but avoid setting it unnecessarily high.
- After dependency changes, always run `npm install` and check for duplicate or conflicting types.

## 2. Code Consistency and Linting
- Use consistent import styles (prefer ES6 imports over `require` for TypeScript).
- Run linting (`npm run lint`) after each round of changes to catch issues like duplicate identifiers or trailing commas early.
- Use VS Code's search to quickly find duplicate declarations or imports.

## 3. Collaboration and Review
- Summarize all changes and rationale at the end of each round in a dedicated markdown file for team review.
- Encourage team members to comment directly on the suggestions file before the next round begins.
- Consider using PRs for each round to leverage GitHub's review tools.

## 4. Automation and Testing
- Automate dependency and type checks in CI to catch issues before merging.
- Run extension tests after each round to ensure nothing is broken.

## 5. Communication
- Clearly state the goals and scope for each round at the start.
- Document any blockers or uncertainties for group discussion.
