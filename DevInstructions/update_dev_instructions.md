# AI-Friendly, Modular Development: Outstanding Implementation Tasks

## General Principles
- All new features and refactors must be implemented in a modular fashion: each logical unit (UI, backend, data, reasoning, etc.) should be in its own file or directory.
- Avoid monolithic files; use helpers, services, and clear interfaces.
- Document all modules and their APIs for AI and human maintainability.
- Prefer composition over inheritance; use dependency injection where possible.
- Ensure all modules are discoverable and testable in isolation.
- Use clear, consistent naming and avoid ambiguous types (no `any`, `unknown`, or `@ts-ignore`).
- All error handling should be user-friendly and structured for both UI and logs.

---

## 1. Modularization & Code Quality (Foundational)
- [x] Modularize large files and move logic to helpers/services where appropriate.
- [ ] Remove duplicate or unused code, especially in legacy or migrated files.
- [ ] Add error handling, documentation, and modular helpers as recommended in the review.
- [x] Clean up and modularize `mindmap.js` and `mindmapOntology.ts` (remove duplicates, broken code, ensure single declarations).

## 2. Error Handling & Robustness (Foundational)
- [ ] Replace all generic error messages and `console.error` calls with user-friendly notifications and structured logging.
- [ ] Add robust error handling for all file I/O, model loading, and user input in all components and tools.
- [ ] Remove or refactor all uses of `as any`, `unknown`, and `@ts-ignore` for better type safety.

## 3. Semantic Web Reasoning Engines & Tools (Core Backend)
- [ ] Implement all reasoning engine stubs: RDFS, OWL RL/DL, SHACL, SPARQL, RuleML, ODRL, CogAI, SWRL, and generic rule-based engines. (Currently only stubs or TODOs.)
- [ ] Implement ontology loading, reasoning, SPARQL querying, and SHACL validation in `toolsSystem.js` and related files.
- [ ] Integrate reasoning engines with the UI for selection, invocation, and result display.
- [ ] Implement embedded triple store support in `semanticWeb.ts`.
- [ ] Complete error handling and user feedback for all reasoning and conversion operations.
- [ ] Integrate backend for real SPARQL execution (`sparql.js`).
- [ ] Remove or complete all `throw new Error('Not implemented')` and similar stubs.

## 4. Semantic Web Integration (Core Backend & UI)
- [ ] UI/API: Upload/reference ontologies (OWL, RDF, etc.).
- [ ] UI/API: Validate uploaded ontologies.
- [ ] UI/API: Create new ontologies from scratch (wizard/tools).
- [ ] UI/API: Export ontologies in all standard formats.
- [ ] Conversion: Tools to convert between serializations (OWL, Turtle, JSON-LD, etc.).
- [ ] API: Expose converted ontologies for LLMs.
- [ ] Documentation: Guide for LLM consumption of ontologies.
- [ ] Enhancements: Ontology import/export UI, validation, visualization, editing, versioning, metadata, namespace/mapping management, SPARQL querying, triple store integration, data validation, modular UI, accessibility, theming, notifications, automation API, LLM integration, project templates, CI/CD, performance, documentation, community contributions.

## 5. Framework Integration (Core Backend & UI)
- [ ] UI: Webview form for selecting/adding frameworks and versions.
- [ ] UI: Add/remove/view frameworks in the UI; display details and docs.
- [ ] Backend: Store/retrieve selected frameworks in project/instruction data.
- [ ] Backend: Validate framework names/versions (autocomplete/suggestions).
- [ ] Backend: Parse user instructions for framework requirements.
- [ ] Backend: Load framework definitions from `.automator/frameworks/`.
- [ ] Automation: Install frameworks using correct package manager.
- [ ] Automation: Generate/update config files (e.g., `package.json`).
- [ ] Automation: Add boilerplate/starter code for frameworks.
- [ ] Automation: Document frameworks/versions in README/metadata.
- [ ] Specification: Define JSON schema for framework resource definitions.
- [ ] Documentation: Document process for adding new frameworks.
- [ ] Examples: Implement/test flows for VS Code extension, Obsidian plugin, Solid app, mobile app, watch app, ReSpec docs.
- [ ] Error Handling: Clear errors for unsupported/invalid frameworks.
- [ ] Advanced: Support custom scripts, presets/templates, online registry integration.

## 6. Automator Folder (Infrastructure)
- [ ] Activation: Detect `.automator/` folder on extension activation.
- [ ] UI: Notification/panel if missing, with options to create.
- [ ] UI: Webview panel for creation flow (button, form, agent input).
- [ ] Backend: Functions to check/create folder and settings file.
- [ ] Backend: Handle form/agent input to generate resources.
- [ ] Agent: Use LLM to parse project descriptions and suggest structure.
- [ ] Settings: Define minimal `settings.json` schema.
- [ ] Extensibility: Plan for adding frameworks, ontologies, templates, etc.
- [ ] Enhancements: Templates for project types, import/export configs, validation, multi-root, telemetry.

## 7. Automator Panel (UI)
- [ ] UI: Implement all listed buttons and their backend logic.
- [ ] UI: Dialogue log area for system/user messages.
- [ ] UI: Command input box and send button.
- [ ] Integration: Ensure all panel actions are logged and provide feedback.
- [ ] Accessibility: ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation.
- [ ] Extensibility: Filtering/searching log, rich formatting, contextual help.

## 8. Available Commands (UI & Backend)
- [ ] Ensure all commands are implemented and registered.
- [ ] Add missing commands (e.g., `sendPrompt`, `acceptSuggestion`, `logInteraction`).
- [ ] Document command purposes, expected behavior, and implementation notes.

## 9. Mindmap Ontology (Advanced Features)
- [ ] Collaboration: Real-time collaboration, commenting/review, export/share, access control.
- [ ] Automation: Pattern detection.
- [ ] Extensibility: Data sync (in progress), accessibility, performance.
- [ ] Future: VR/AR, voice commands, automated testing, gamification.

**Next Steps:**
- Work from foundational to advanced tasks, respecting dependencies (e.g., modularization and error handling before new features).
- Assign owners for each area (UI, backend, automation, documentation).
- Track progress and update this checklist as features are implemented.
- Ensure all new code and refactors follow the modular, AI-friendly principles above.
