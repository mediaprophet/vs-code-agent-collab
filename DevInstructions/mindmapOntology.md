### 4. Semantic Web Integration

## Semantic Web Reasoning Integration Considerations

### Integration Features & Enhancements Required

- **Engine Registration:** All reasoning engines must be registered in the tools system at runtime so they are available to the mindmap and other components.
- **Dynamic Engine/Profile Listing:** The mindmap UI must dynamically list all available reasoning engines and their supported profiles for user selection.
- **UI Selection & Invocation:** Users must be able to select a reasoning engine/profile from the UI and invoke reasoning directly from the mindmap workspace.
- **Result Handling & Display:** Reasoning results (e.g., inferred triples, validation reports, rule outputs) must be handled and displayed in the mindmap UI, with clear feedback and integration into the ontology view.
- **Error Handling:** The UI must provide clear error messages and recovery options if reasoning fails or is misconfigured.
- **Extensible API:** The integration must allow for future engines, profiles, and result types to be added with minimal changes to the UI or backend.

These enhancements are required for full, user-facing integration of the reasoning engines with the mindmap tool.

To ensure robust, extensible, and future-proof semantic web reasoning integration, the following considerations must be met:

- **RDFS Reasoning Engine:** _done_ (Basic RDFS reasoning engine module implemented. July 31, 2025)

- **OWL RL/DL Reasoning Engine:** _done_ (Basic OWL RL/DL reasoning engine module implemented. July 31, 2025)

- **SHACL Reasoning Engine:** _done_ (Basic SHACL reasoning engine module implemented. July 31, 2025)

- **SPARQL Reasoning Engine:** _done_ (Basic SPARQL reasoning engine module implemented. July 31, 2025)

- **Rule-Based Reasoning Engine:** _done_ (Basic rule-based reasoning engine module implemented. July 31, 2025)

- **CogAI Reasoning Engine:** _done_ (Basic CogAI reasoning engine module implemented. July 31, 2025)

- **RuleML Reasoning Engine:** _done_ (Basic RuleML reasoning engine module implemented. July 31, 2025)

- **ODRL Reasoning Engine:** _done_ (Basic ODRL reasoning engine module implemented. July 31, 2025)

- **SWRL Reasoning Engine:** _done_ (Basic SWRL reasoning engine module implemented. July 31, 2025)

- **Pluggable Reasoning API:** The system must define an abstract interface for reasoning, allowing multiple engines (e.g., RDFS, OWL RL/DL, SHACL, SPARQL, rule-based) to be plugged in or swapped without codebase changes.
- **Pluggable Reasoning API:** The system must define an abstract interface for reasoning, allowing multiple engines (e.g., RDFS, OWL RL/DL, SHACL, SPARQL, rule-based, CogAI, RuleML, ODRL) to be plugged in or swapped without codebase changes.
- **No Tool Lock-In:** Avoid hard dependencies on any single reasoning engine or library. All data must be stored and exchanged in standard RDF/OWL formats (e.g., Turtle, RDF/XML, JSON-LD).
- **Engine/Profile Selection:** The UI must expose reasoning engine/profile selection, allowing users to choose or configure the reasoning backend at runtime.
- **Extensibility:** The reasoning interface must support future engines, custom rule sets, and new profiles with minimal changes.
- **Standard Protocols:** Where possible, use standard protocols (e.g., SPARQL endpoints, SHACL validation APIs) for communication with reasoning engines.
- **Clear Separation:** Keep reasoning logic separate from UI and data management, using a well-defined API boundary.

### Supported and Considered Standards

- [W3C CogAI](https://github.com/w3c/cogai): Cognitive AI Interchange format for rules, logic, and knowledge representation.
- [RuleML](https://www.w3.org/2005/rules/wg/wiki/RuleML): Rule Markup Language for expressing rules and logic on the web.
- [ODRL Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/): Open Digital Rights Language for expressing policies, permissions, and constraints.

These standards should be supported or considered for integration as reasoning profiles, rule formats, or policy engines within the pluggable reasoning API.

These requirements ensure the mindmap ontology tooling remains flexible, interoperable, and maintainable as semantic web technologies evolve.
