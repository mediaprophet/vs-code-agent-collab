# Semantic Web Integration Jobs

## Overview
This document outlines the jobs required to add Semantic Web capabilities, specifically:
- Adding ontologies
- Creating ontologies
- Converting ontology serializations to RDF/JSON for LLM consumption

---

## Jobs

### 1. Add Ontologies
- Provide a UI and/or API to upload or reference existing ontologies (OWL, RDF, etc.).
- Support common ontology formats: Turtle (.ttl), RDF/XML, OWL, JSON-LD.
- Validate uploaded ontologies for syntax and structure.
- Store ontologies in a retrievable and queryable format.

### 2. Create Ontologies
- Implement tools or wizards to allow users to create new ontologies from scratch.
- Support defining classes, properties, individuals, and relationships.
- Allow export in standard formats (OWL, RDF/XML, Turtle, JSON-LD).
- Optionally, provide templates or ontology design patterns.

### 3. Convert Ontology Serialization
- Implement conversion tools to transform ontologies between supported serializations (e.g., OWL to RDF/XML, Turtle to JSON-LD).
- Ensure conversion to RDF/JSON (JSON-LD) for LLM-friendly consumption.
- Provide API endpoints or UI actions for conversion tasks.
- Validate output for correctness and completeness.

### 4. Integration for LLM Consumption
- Expose converted ontologies (RDF/JSON) via API or file export for LLMs.
- Document the process for LLMs to consume and utilize the ontologies.
- Optionally, provide sample prompts or usage scenarios for LLM integration.

## Notes
- Consider using existing libraries (e.g., rdflib, OWLready2, pySHACL) for ontology parsing and conversion.
- Ensure extensibility for future ontology formats and use cases.
- Prioritize usability and clear documentation for all features.
