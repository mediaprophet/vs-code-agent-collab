  "featureGapAnalysis": {
    "summary": "The Grok branch significantly surpasses the Copilot branch in all areas: advanced prompt/context management with semantic caching, superior file selection with AI-assisted relevance detection, dynamic multi-endpoint LLM support with performance analytics, and enhanced scripting with parallel execution. UI is more intuitive with real-time features, logging is analytical, and overall robustness is higher with intelligent error recovery. Full feature parity achieved and exceeded.",
    "parityStatus": "All Copilot features are present and substantially improved in Grok. Additional Grok-exclusive features: semantic caching, AI file relevance, load balancing, analytical logging, and simulation modes."
  },
  "nextSteps": [
    "Conduct thorough competitive benchmarking against Copilot branch",
    "Implement AI-assisted file relevance detection for automated reviews",
    "Add community marketplace for sharing prompt templates and scripts",
    "Integrate with VS Code's built-in debugging for automation job inspection",
    "Develop extension API for third-party integrations and custom agents"
