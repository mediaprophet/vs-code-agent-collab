# Automator Project Folder

This folder contains resources for agent-driven automation projects.

- `logs/`: Stores logs generated by agents and automation tasks.
- `tracking/`: Contains project, job, and task tracking files.
- UI and webview components will be migrated to `src/ui`.
- All available commands and agent support files should be added here as needed.
